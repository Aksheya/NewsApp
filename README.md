# NewsApp - (React, NodeJs)
This project is a part of CSCI571. A web application implemented in React and NodeJs hosted on GCP, which displays top headlines for both New York Times and
Guardian News. The webapp also provides features to display section based articles. Each article can be
shared by the user on Facebook, Twitter or via Email. For each article, after expanding, the user can add comments on the articles. Search feature enables users to search for relevant articles. Autosuggestions feature is also incorporated so as to aid users in their search query. Users can bookmark their favourite articles and easily access them as and when required.
